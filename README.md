# MyMarlinConfig
This is my personal Marlin config which I will update.

It is optimised for a BTT Mini E3 V1.2-mainboard with a bltouch. The bltouch is wired
to the "probe" port of the board. The board uses the bltouch to home the z-axis, too.
The regular z-endstop microswitch is suppposed to stay in the z endstop connector.
